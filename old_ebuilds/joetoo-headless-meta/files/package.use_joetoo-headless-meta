# Enable/disable any metapackage USE flags you want here, and then
# re-emerge dev-embedded/joetoo-headless-meta to have the effect taken up
# e.g. you might set (uncommented):
#
#     dev-embedded/joetoo-headless-meta -lamp
#
# to disable the automated weekly genup (package update)
# run.
#
# Unless you override them, the default metapackage flags are used.
# At the time of writing, those are (default flag status shown as + or -):
#
#  + innercore     : pull in baseline packages required by the headless meta
#  + lamp          : pull in packages required for a LAMP server
#    + mysql         : pull in the mysql database and required packages
#    - mariadb       : pull in the mariadb database and required packages
#  + mkinitramfs   : pull in the joetoo initramfs builder packages
#  + nextcloud     : pull in the nextcloud package and its dependencies
#  +ntp            : pull in ntp to sync with time source
#  -chrony         : pull in chrony to sync with time source
#  +sysklogd       : pull in sysklogd as system logger
#  -syslog-ng      : pull in syslog-ng as system logger
#  +netifrc        : pull in netifrc to manage network
#  -networkmanager : pull in netifrc to manage network

#
# NB the main point of these USE flags is just to let
# you reduce what is in your @world set (/var/lib/portage/world)
