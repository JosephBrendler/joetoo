please use the provided template .conf files to create your own configs

note that the eselect module will allow you to select from among any
config file whose name begins "qemu-tools_" and ends ".conf"

for example, I created a .conf for my raspi3b+ image as follows
# cp /etc/qemu-tools/qemu-tools_bcm2710-rpi-3-b-plus_template.conf \
     /etc/qemu-tools/qemu-tools_raspi364q1.conf
