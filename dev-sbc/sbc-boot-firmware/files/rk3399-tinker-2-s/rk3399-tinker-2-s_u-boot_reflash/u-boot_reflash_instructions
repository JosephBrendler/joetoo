To re-flash u-boot on your SD card with the u-boot image compiled for the current build,
follow these instructions --

  root # cd /path/to/u-boot
  root # dd if=idbloader.img of=/dev/mmcblk1 seek=64
  root # dd if=u-boot.itb of=/dev/mmcblk1 seek=16384

Notes:
(1) u-boot.itb is written starting at sector 16384. 
    Make sure your card is partitioned such that there's no filesystem there.
(2) Be sure to replace "/dev/mmcblk1" with the correct device!

(3) You can also re-compile u-boot from scratch...
