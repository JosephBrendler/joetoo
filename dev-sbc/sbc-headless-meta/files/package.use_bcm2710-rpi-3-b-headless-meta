# Enable/disable any metapackage USE flags you want here, and then
# re-emerge dev-embedded/raspi64-headless-meta to have the effect taken up
# e.g. you might set (uncommented):
#
#    dev-embedded/raspi32-headless-meta -lamp
#
# to disable the automated weekly genup (package update)
# run.
#
# Unless you override them, the default metapackage flags are used.
# At the time of writing, those are (default flag status shown as + or -):
#
#  + boot-fw   : pull in the /boot firmware, configs and bootloader
#  + innercore : Pull in baseline packages required by the headless meta
#  + gpio      : Pull in the libgpiod package and its dependencies
#
# NB the main point of these USE flags is just to let
# you reduce what is in your @world set (/var/lib/portage/world)
