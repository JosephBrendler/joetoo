Note:  config_protect_boot will protect u-boot files, but joetoo does not yet have
u-boot development implemented for this board

thus, this ebuild does not yet deliver boot.cmd, boot.scr, nor the u-boot_reflash files
needed for this board -- if needed, they can be retrieved from armbian/build output .deb files
