To re-flash u-boot on your boot device, with the u-boot image compiled for the current build,
follow these instructions, based on asus' flash.sh which can be found in
u-boot_reflash_resources/Tinker_Edge_T-Mendel-Eagle-V3.0.7-20210610  --

(1) download Mendel OS image achive by selecting "Tinker Edge T" in the dropdown selector at --
     https://tinker-board.asus.com/download-list.html
     then follow README.txt (also provided here in u-boot_reflash_resources/ under 
     asus_tinker-edge-t_u-boot_reflash_resources/Tinker_Edge_T-Mendel-Eagle-V3.0.7-20210610/

Note: this will require you to use a windows or linux PC to write a new sd card which will
     have the new u-boot on it (but will also have Mendel linux)
     replace the contents of the root partition on that SD card with your gentoo system

Note Do this ONLY if your old system's u-boot has been corrupted and won't boot

Note:  to build u-boot from scratch and install it separately, follow --
    - https://github.com/nxp-imx/uboot-imx (see README.md at bottom of page)

Note:  see also the resource below, which may also be useful --

Other Notes:
(0) The above procedure has NOT been verified for fsl-imx8mq-phanbell

(2) u-boot (2016.9+) assigns mmcblk0 to whatever device u-boot is loaded from.  So,
when that is a MTD block device, the boot sd card may be /dev/mmcblk1
 
(3) First partition should start at sector 16384, to leave room for u-boot images written
    with this method.  For example, see this layout

# fdisk -l /dev/mmcblk1 (on working fsl-imx8mq-phanbell edget6401 )---------------
Disk /dev/mmcblk1: 14.88 GiB, 15978201088 bytes, 31207424 sectors
