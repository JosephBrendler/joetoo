You should not need to reflash u-boot for meson-gxl-s905x-libretech-cc-v2, since the bootloader
is installed in SPI NOR on this board and uses efi to start grub to launch the kernel and initrd
on this system... (updating grub should normally suffice)

According to advice from Libre Computer at
  https://hub.libre.computer/t/2025-07-03-libre-computer-aml-s905d3-cc-solitude-aml-a311d-alta-aml-s905x-cc-v2-sweet-potato-aml-s805x-ac-la-frite-aml-s905x-cc-le-potato-firmware-update/4825
The latest firmware update (at link below) includes the following features:
  gzip compressed boot.bmp bootup images
  intelligent boot device detection for boot logo and ini load
  Wake-on-LAN via sudo ethtool -s end0 wol g
  u-boot to version v2025.07
  firmware self-update function
Download it here - https://boot.libre.computer/release/aml-s905x-cc-v2/aml-s905x-cc-v2-spiflash.img

(1) Burn this image to a microSD card (*) see quality caveat below at (2), using dd or a program like
balena etcher.  Note that balena etcher will now let you flash the SD card using the URL as a source
    wget -O - 'URL' | xz -dc | sudo dd of=/dev/DEVICE bs=1M status=progress
    # replace URL with the link to the image, do not remove quote
    # replace DEVICE with the target drive such as sdX or mmcblkX, this will be different on macOS

(2) Boot - (this will boot to a black/white boot menu)
(3) Select "Firmware update" (this will install updated u-boot described above, including efi-scanner)
(4) When it returns "Firmware update successful" power down and remove the SD card
(5) Insert a microSD card with a bootable EFI image (including grub menu) and boot again
(for example, use the "arm64-uefi" image built by armbian/build for all uefi enabled arm64 boards)

(1) See my posted question about SD card that boots from a USB card reader but not from SD card slot --
    https://hub.libre.computer/t/2025-07-03-libre-computer-aml-s905d3-cc-solitude-aml-a311d-alta-aml-s905x-cc-v2-sweet-potato-aml-s805x-ac-la-frite-aml-s905x-cc-le-potato-firmware-update/4825/3?u=joeb
    response:  "Solitude is more picky about MicroSD card than Alta and Sweet Potato ...
    Stick to legit Tier 1 and it should work"
    Also saw elsewhere: "We recommend SanDisk and Samsung MicroSD because those brands have a history
     of making reliability (sic.) products. There are knockoffs that appear on Amazon.
     Kingston, PNY, and other brands have put out unreliable products in the past
     so we do [NOT] recommend them...
     To test read speed, run
       sudo dd if=$(findmnt -nvo SOURCE /) of=/dev/null bs=1M iflag=direct status=progress
     Press Control+C to end. If this drops below 20MB/s, we recommend another card.
     To test write speed, run 
       openssl enc -aes-128-ctr -pass pass:"$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=128 count=1 2>/dev/null | \
         base64)" -nosalt < /dev/zero | \
         dd of=test.file iflag=fullblock oflag=direct bs=1M status=progress
     Press Control+C to end. If this drops below 15MB/s, we recommend another card."

(2) Be sure to replace DEVICE with the correct device, e.g. /dev/sdb or /dev/mmcblk1
 
(3) u-boot (2016.9+) assigns mmcblk0 to whatever device u-boot is loaded from.  So,
when that is a MTD block device (e.g. SPI NOR) as in the case of meson-gxl-s905x-libretech-cc-v2, the boot sd card will be
/dev/mmcblk1

(4) You can also re-compile u-boot from scratch... and boot using the boot.scr script and joetooEnv.txt example
    provided by sys-boot/sbc-boot-config, which are basically unused otherwise

(5) First partition should start at sector 8192, to leave room for u-boot images written
    with this method.  For example, see this layout

(6) note that the armbian layout for meson-gxl-s905x-libretech-cc-v2 mounts 
the vfat (EFI System) partition as /boot/efi

#---( alternative based on armbian "sweetpotato" build with which lcsp6401/2 were built )-------
To re-flash u-boot on your boot device, with the u-boot image compiled for the current build,
follow these instructions, based on armbian's platform_install.sh which can be found in
u-boot_reflash_resources/usr/lib/u-boot/  --

    # (as root)
    cd /path/to/linux-u-boot-current-rock-5b/
    target=<devicename>

    dd if=u-boot.bin of=${target} bs=1 count=442 conv=fsync 2>&1;
    dd if=u-boot.bin of=${target} bs=512 skip=1 seek=1 conv=fsync 2>&1

Notes:
(0) The above procedure has not yet been verified for meson-gxl-s905x-libretech-cc-v2

(1) The platform_install.sh script seems to use only the u-boot.bin file that is provided here

(2) Be sure to replace <devicename> with the correct device, e.g. /dev/mmcblk1
 
(3) u-boot (2016.9+) assigns mmcblk0 to whatever device u-boot is loaded from.  So,
when that is a MTD block device as in the case of rock-5b, the boot sd card will be
/dev/mmcblk1

(4) You can also re-compile u-boot from scratch...

(5) First partition should start at sector 8192, to leave room for u-boot images written
