# VERBOSE - Logical dependent on script_header_brendlefly, use for debugging
#VERBOSE=$TRUE
#
# verbosity - how much debug info? higer # = more
#verbosity=3
#
# user - used to set ownership of embedded kernel development files
#user="joe"
#
# arch - what architecture?
#arch="arm"
arch="arm64"
#
# cross_compile - tuple indicating target for cross-compilation
#cross_compile="armv7a-unknown-linux-gnueabihf-"
cross_compile="aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-"
#
# model - what device? Used to select device tree file (dtb), so it must name a dtb file produced by
#         the command "${make_embedded} dtbs" (run manually in kernel build directory to list)
#model="rk3288-tinker-s"
model="bcm2712-rpi-5-b"
#
# image - what is the name of the make target used to generate kernel image
#image="Image"
image="zImage"
#
# dtb_folder - name of folder in which "make dtbs" places dtb files (if used)
#dtb_folder=""
dtb_folder="broadcom"
#
# build_root - path to cross development directory tree for this arch/target/model
#build_root="/home/joe/My_rk3288-tinker-s_Project"
build_root="/home/joe/My_bcm2712-rpi-5-b_project"
#
# my_devel_dir - source repository from which to upload content to github (omit trailing '/')
#my_devel_dir="/home/joe/myUtilities"
#
# my_ebuild_dir - ebuild repository from which to upload content to github (omit trailing '/')
#my_ebuild_dir="/home/joe/joetoo/sys-kernel"
#
# Note: if it doesn't exist, the first run of kernelupdate-embedded will create
#  the build_root directory tree.
#
# First run will also explain that you must retreive kernel sources and
#  symlink ${build_root}/linux to those sources.
# The program will keep that directory clean and build your output -
#  kernel(s), modules, and dtb file(s) in the ${distrib_dir}
