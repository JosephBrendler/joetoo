# Enable/disable any metapackage USE flags you want here, and then
# re-emerge dev-embedded/joetoo-headless-meta to have the effect taken up
# e.g. you might set (uncommented):
#
#     dev-embedded/joetoo-headless-meta -lamp
#
# to disable the automated weekly genup (package update)
# run.
#
# Unless you override them, the default metapackage flags are used.
# At the time of writing, those are (default flag status shown as + or -):
#
#  + innercore   : Pull in baseline packages required by the headless meta
#  + lamp        : Pull in packages required for a LAMP server
#    + mysql       : pull in the mysql database and required packages
#    - mariadb     : pull in the mariadb database and required packages
#  + mkinitramfs : pull in the joetoo initramfs builder packages
#  + nextcloud   : Pull in the nextcloud package and its dependencies
#
# NB the main point of these USE flags is just to let
# you reduce what is in your @world set (/var/lib/portage/world)
